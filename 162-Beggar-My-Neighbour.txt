/* 162-Beggar-My-Neighbour
 * “Beggar My Neighbour” (sometimes known as “Strip Jack Naked”) is a traditional card game, designed
 * to help teach beginners something about cards and their values. A standard deck is shuffled and dealt
 * face down to the two players, the first card to the non-dealer, the second to the dealer, and so on until
 * each player has 26 cards. The dealer receives the last card. The non-dealer starts the game by playing
 * the top card of her deck (the second last card dealt) face up on the table. The dealer then covers it by
 * playing her top card face up. Play continues in this fashion until a “face” card (Ace, King, Queen or
 * Jack) is played. The next player must then “cover” that card, by playing one card for a Jack, two for a
 * Queen, three for a King and four for an Ace. If a face card is played at any stage during this sequence,
 * play switches and the other player must cover that card. When this sequence has ended, the player
 * who exposed the last face card takes the entire heap, placing it face down under her existing deck. She
 * then starts the next round by playing one card face up as before, and play continues until one player
 * cannot play when called upon to do so, because they have no more cards.
 *
 * Write a program that will simulate playing this game. Remember that a standard deck (or pack)
 * of cards contains 52 cards. These are divided into 4 suits — Spades (♠), Hearts (♡), Diamonds (♢)
 * and Clubs (♣). Within each suit there are 13 cards — Ace (A), 2–9, Ten (T), Jack (J), Queen (Q) and
 * King (K).
 *
 * Input
 * Input will consist of a series of decks of cards. Each deck will give the cards in order as they would
 * be dealt (that is in the example deck below, the non-dealer would start the game by playing the ‘H2’).
 * Decks will occupy 4 lines with 13 cards on each. The designation of each card will be the suit (S, H, D,
 * C) followed by the rank (A, 2–9, T, J, Q, K). There will be exactly one space between cards. The file will
 * be terminated by a line consisting of a single ‘#’.
 *
 * Output
 * Output will consist of a series of lines, one for each deck in the input. Each line will consist of the
 * number of the winning player (1 is the dealer, 2 is the first to playBeggarMyNeighbour) and the number of cards in the
 * winner’s hand (ignoring any on the stack), right justified in dealCards field of width 3. */
